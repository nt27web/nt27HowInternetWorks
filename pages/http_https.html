                <h2>HTTP and HTTPS protocols</h2></p>

                <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the
                    inventor of the World Wide Web. He is a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the University of
                    Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Berners-Lee proposed an
                    information management system on 12 March 1989, then implemented the first successful communication
                    between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol <b>(HTTP)</b> client and server via the internet in
                    mid-November. </p>

                <p> Before we dive deeper into understanding about HTTP and HTTPS protocol, let us try to understand the
                    meaning of the word protocol. </p>

                <p><b>What is a Protocol? </b></p>
                <p>A Protocol is a <b>set of rules</b> that we use for specific purposes. In the current scenario, when
                    we are talking about protocols, it is about communication- the way we talk to each other. For
                    instance, a newsreader speaks in English and because you understand English, you can understand.
                    English is the protocol. </p>
                <p>The moment the newsreader starts speaking in a language that you do not understand, the protocol
                    beats its purpose. Thus, we need both the parties to agree to a set of rules for the communication
                    to take place. The protocol, in this case, is for communication. </p>
                <p>Now, talking about the web multiple protocols are used to communicate. Primarily for end users, the
                    most important and visible protocols are HTTP and HTTPS. Though there are many other protocols as
                    well, HTTP and HTTPS protocols cater to most of the population. </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                <h3>What is HTTP? </h3></p>

                <p>HTTP is Hypertext transfer protocol. Simply put - Rules to sending and receiving text-based messages.
                    As we all know, computers work in a language of 1's and 0's i.e. Binary language. Therefore,
                    potentially every set of 1's and 0's construct something, it could be a word. </p>

                <div class="text-center">
                    <img class="rounded float-none" src="../images/httpstructure_edited.jpg"/>
                    <p class="font-italic">-HTTP Structure</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Let us say I want to write 'a'. Now, if 0 stands for 'a', 1 stands for 'b', and 01 stands for 'c', I
                    can infer that a combination of 0's and 1's can construct a word as well. In this case, the text is
                    already constructed and is being sent on the wire. The computer works on many languages - pure
                    binary, text, and some other formats like byte codes. Here, what is being transferred is text. We am
                    emphasizing on 'text' because this text is interpreted by the browser and the moment browser
                    interprets it, it becomes hypertext, and the protocol that transfers the text is referred to as
                    hypertext transfer protocol - HTTP. Using HTTP, you can transfer images and text and even sound, but
                    not videos. </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                <h3>What is HTTPS? </h3></p>

                <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which
                    data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of
                    HTTPS stands for <b>'Secure'</b>. It means all communications between your browser and the website
                    are encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online
                    banking and online shopping order forms. </p>

                <p><b>How does HTTPS work? </b></p>
                <p>HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer
                    Security <b>(TLS)</b>, although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol
                    secures communications by using what is known as an <b>asymmetric public key infrastructure.</b></p>

                <P>This type of security system uses two different keys to encrypt communications between two
                    parties:</p>
                <p>The private key - this key is controlled by the owner of a website and it has kept, as the reader
                    may have speculated, private. This key lives on a web server and is used to decrypt information
                    encrypted by the public key. </p>
                <p>The public key - this key is available to everyone who wants to interact with the server in a way
                    that is secure. Information that is encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the
                    private key. </p>

                <br>
                <p><b>Why is HTTPS important? What happens if a website does not have HTTPS? </b></p>

                <p>HTTPS prevents websites from having their information broadcast in a way that is easily viewed by
                    anyone snooping on the network. When information is sent over regular HTTP, the information is
                    broken into packets of data that can be easily “sniffed” using free software. This makes
                    communication over an unsecure medium, such as public Wi-Fi, highly vulnerable to interception.
                    In fact, all communications that occur over HTTP occur in plain text, making them highly
                    accessible to anyone with the correct tools, and vulnerable to on-path attacks. </p>

                <p>With HTTPS, traffic is encrypted such that even if the packets are sniffed or otherwise
                    intercepted, they will come across as nonsensical characters. Let us look at an example:</p>

                <p><b>Before encryption:</b></p>
                <p><b><code>This is a string of text that is completely readable</code></b></p>

                <p><b>After encryption:</b></p>
                <p><b><code>ITM0IRyiEhVpa6VnKyExMiEgNveroyWBPlgGyfkflYjDaaFf/Kn3bo3OfghBPDWo6AfSHlNtL8N7ITEwIXc1gU5X73xMsJormzzXlwOyrCs+9XCPk63Y+z0=
                </code></b></p>

                <p>In websites without HTTPS, it is possible for Internet service providers (ISPs) or other
                    intermediaries to inject content into webpages without the approval of the website owner.
                    This commonly takes the form of advertising, where an ISP looking to increase revenue
                    injects paid advertising into the webpages of their customers. Unsurprisingly, when this
                    occurs, the profits for the advertisements and the quality control of those advertisements
                    are in no way shared with the website owner. HTTPS eliminates the ability of unmoderated
                    third parties to inject advertising into web content. </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                <h3>Differences between HTTP and HTTPS</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In HTTP, URL begins with “http://” whereas URL starts with “https://”</li>
                    <li>HTTP uses port number 80 for communication and HTTPS uses 443</li>
                    <li>HTTP is unsecure and HTTPS is secure</li>
                    <li>HTTP Works at Application Layer and HTTPS works at Transport Layer</li>
                    <li>In HTTP, Encryption is absent, and Encryption is present in HTTPS as discussed above</li>
                    <li>HTTP does not require any certificates and HTTPS needs SSL Certificates</li>
                </ul>
