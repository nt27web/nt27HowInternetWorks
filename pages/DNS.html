                <h2>DNS</h2></p>

                <p>is one of the most common yet misunderstood components of the web landscape. To put it simply, DNS
                    helps direct traffic on the Internet by connecting domain names with actual web servers.
                    Essentially, it takes a human-friendly request ‚Äì a domain name like kinsta.com ‚Äì and translates it
                    into a computer-friendly server IP address ‚Äì like 216.3.128.12. Because DNS is all about looking up
                    addresses and connecting devices, many people call DNS the ‚Äúphonebook of the Internet‚Äù. Without DNS,
                    you would have to memorize every site‚Äôs IP address to access it which‚Ä¶well, that just would not
                    work! </p>

                <p><b>Types of DNS</b></p>
                <p>There are several types of DNS records you may need to be aware of. The main records include:</p>
                <p>DNS records associate a domain with a web-based service. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A record</li>
                    <li>CNAME records</li>
                    <li>MX records</li>
                    <li>TXT records</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p><b><h3>How Does DNS Work? </h3></b></p>

                <p>When a user enters a URL in their web browser, DNS gets to work to connect that URL to the IP address
                    of the actual server. This is called DNS name resolution and involves a DNS recursor querying
                    various nameservers to figure out the actual IP address of a server.</p>

                    <p class="font-italic">-Four Components of DNS</p>
                </div>

                <p>DNS is mainly concerned with four components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Domain Registrar</li>
                    <li>Nameservers</li>
                    <li>DNS Records</li>
                    <li>Web-based services (such as website hosting and email)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let us talk about these four components and how they work together. </p>

                <p><b>Domain Registrar</b></p>
                <p>A domain registrar is the service provider where domain names are purchased and where domain
                    registration is maintained (such as GoDaddy or Namecheap). </p>

                <p>The registrar is where the domain nameservers are specified. </p>

                <p>Most registrars include basic DNS service with the cost of domain registration. As a result, unless
                    you add custom nameservers to the domain, the domain will use the registrar‚Äôs standard nameservers.
                    This means that in many cases, by default, DNS records are managed by the registrar. </p>

                <p><b>Nameservers</b></p>

                <p>Nameservers are servers much like web servers. However, they are configured to store DNS records
                    rather than to serve up websites or web applications.
                    This means that when you want to change any DNS record you must change those DNS records on the
                    nameservers that have been specified by the registrar or third-party service. </p>

                <p>This step is often a little confusing, so let us break this down a little bit by looking at a
                    fictional example:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Your domain (example.com) is registered at GoDaddy.</li>
                    <li>You add Cloudflare‚Äôs nameservers to example.com within your GoDaddy account to start using
                        Cloudflare.
                    </li>
                    <li>You change a DNS record for example.com at GoDaddy. This change will not do anything because the
                        domain is not using GoDaddy‚Äôs nameservers.
                    </li>
                    <li>You make the same DNS change for example.com at Cloudflare. This change will be effective
                        because the
                        domain is using Cloudflare‚Äôs nameservers.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>So, in other words, if you are only using GoDaddy, you will need to update your DNS records with
                    GoDaddy as they control your nameservers. </p>

                <p><b>How DNS and Nameservers Link Together</b></p>

                <p>To show your website‚Äôs IP address, click the ‚ÄòSites‚Äô link on the left of your dashboard and then
                    choosing the ‚ÄòInfo‚Äô tab which will reveal the basic information that enables your website to be
                    located on the Web.</p>

                <p>Think about IP addresses like phone numbers. Eventually, we ran out of new numbers to give to
                    customers, so we had to change how we organized the phone numbers in use. It is the same with IP
                    addresses. IPv6 gives us more IP addresses to hand out to new websites. As the Web continues to
                    expand, IPv4 simply ran out of IP addresses! </p>

                <p>You may have also heard there are dedicated IP addresses and shared IP addresses. A dedicated IP
                    address is like your landline or mobile phone number; it is unique to you and your website. </p>
                <p>A shared IP address, as its name suggests, is shared by several websites. Shared IP addresses are
                    common with websites that use WordPress. It is important to understand that a shared IP address does
                    not mean your website is sharing other resources as well. </p>

                <p><b>What Is DNS Lookup? </b></p>
                <p>Think about the last time you searched for a website. The time it took from the moment you hit the
                    enter key to the website appearing in your browser has a lot to do with DNS lookup. As you already
                    know, the faster your website can be served to a visitor, the better.</p>

                <p>As you will remember, when someone types your website‚Äôs domain name into their browser, the location
                    of your website must be found. The DNS file associated with your website contains that information
                    including the nameserver and IP address.</p>

                <div class="text-center">
                    <img class="rounded float-none"
                         src="../images/DNS-Propagtion-How-A-website-Is-Found-Using-DNS-Lookup-1_edited.jpg"/>

                    <p class="font-italic">-DNS has a vital role to play to ensure the right webpages are delivered
                        each time a domain is entered or searched for. (Image source:

                </div>

                <p>You can see DNS lookup in action and see how the speed of DNS lookup can impact the performance of
                    your website by using one of the speed test services such as Pingdom.</p>
                <p>If you are asking yourself if you have control over DNS lookup speed as you do over other factors
                    that affect the performance of your website, you would be right. In fact, reducing the speed of DNS
                    lookups can be achieved in several ways.</p>

                <br>
                <p>
                <h3>Web Services</h3></p>

                <p>In our case, the web service is website hosting. An A record (or AAAA record) must be added to a
                    domain‚Äôs nameservers to associate that domain with the web servers that host the website. </p>
                <p>There are many other types of web services that are associated with a domain through DNS records:
                    email, SFTP, hosting control panels, webmail applications, and phpMyAdmin just to name a few. </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                <h3>DNS Propagation</h3></p>

                <p>When you make a change to the DNS of a given domain ‚Äì such as updating a DNS record or switching
                    nameservers ‚Äì those changes take some time to take effect. This time is called propagation.</p>
                <p>Propagation varies considerably from one situation to the next. In the case of DNS records, each
                    record has an associated <b>time-to-live (TTL)</b> value. This value determines how quickly changes
                    to DNS
                    records will take effect. </p>

                <p>In most cases, TTL for DNS records is set to 1 or 4 hours by default. This means that most of the
                    time DNS changes will take as much as 4 hours to take effect. Higher TTL values are also possible
                    and will mean that when a DNS record is updated that it will take more time before the changes take
                    full effect. In some extreme cases, some might have TTL values as high as one week. </p>
                <p>In the case of nameservers, the registrar determines the TTL value and it generally cannot be
                    changed. This means that when you switch to new nameservers it can take from a few minutes up to a
                    day or longer for those changes to take effect. </p>

                <p>The hosting provider cannot speed up DNS propagation. What you can do is reduce TTL well in advance
                    of making any changes to DNS records so that the changes propagate as quickly as possible. You can
                    use an online tool like whatsmydns.net to test to see if your DNS changes have finished
                    propagating. </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                <h3>DNS Configuration ‚Äì How to Set up Your Domain </h3></p>
                <p>There are two ways that you will commonly set up your DNS. One method is to simply point your
                    domain‚Äôs nameservers to your host‚Äôs name servers via your domain name registrar. These are a minimum
                    of two separate URLs that look something like this (you can have more than two URLs, just not
                    fewer):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ns1.yourhost.com</li>
                    <li>ns2.yourhost.com</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <p>
                <h3>To Summarize</h3></p>
                <p>Hopefully, you understand a little more now about how DNS works. To recap, DNS is used to associate
                    web-based services, such as website hosting and email, with a domain name. This involves four
                    steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The domain must be registered with a domain registrar.</li>
                    <li>Nameservers must be specified by the domain registrar.</li>
                    <li>DNS records must be added to the nameservers specified by the domain registrar or third-party
                        service
                        such as Cloudflare.
                    </li>
                    <li>The DNS records must be fully propagated to associate the domain with each relevant web
                        service.
                    </li>
                </ol>
