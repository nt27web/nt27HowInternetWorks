                <p>The Internet's origin goes back to the 1950s and has touched so many lives since then. During the
                    Gulf war, a crisis arose to be better informed, and the U.S. Department of Defense decided to fund
                    <b>ARPANET</b> for their research in this area. At that time, ARPANET used packet switching allowing
                    multiple computers to communicate with each other on a single network. Years of study and work in
                    this field led to the first message delivered from a "node to node" communication from one computer
                    to another by ARPAnet on October 29, 1969. </p>

                <p>During the 1950s, telephone exchange worked differently where a middleman had to connect the two
                    callers, and when the connection path was broken, the call was lost. Damaged communication and
                    security became a national concern during the Soviet Nuclear attacks in the early 60s. The telephone
                    exchange wanted to analyze and improve its operations to resolve this issue. <b>Dr. Paul Baran</b> was
                    hired to research around how many circuits would be required to provide a method that allows users
                    to talk with the person on the other end of the call without being on hold for too long. That is
                    when a notion occurred called the <b>Hot potato routing</b>, which meant that the message finds its path
                    and reaches the destination even if a part of the network was destroyed. </p>
                <div class="text-center">

                    <img src="../images/micemaze2.jpg" class="rounded float-left" alt="..." style="width:400px;height:400px;">
                </div>
                <p>To achieve this, Baran was inspired by the 'mice in a maze' concept, like the mouse finds its way
                    through the maze similarly, information must find its way through the network to reach the
                    destination. Next, the message was broken into smaller 'packets.' Each packet had a 'from' and a
                    'to' address. These packets were allowed to take their own paths in the network based on the
                    availability from one node to another, just like a post office. By 1962 there was a great deal of
                    theory that showed a network could be built based on this packet switching mechanism, but it had to
                    wait seven years to be implemented in 1969. </p>

                <p>The first Computer network came into life by Bob Taylor, an ARPAnet scientist. The new big idea in
                    1966 was 'Time sharing' Bob Taylor needed a separate terminal to login into numerous time-sharing
                    terminals at research centers across the country. He knew that a single terminal could suffice if
                    all the computers were on a shared network. He was allocated 1 million$ by ARPAnet to bring this
                    theory to life that changed the entire world 20 years ago, which nobody had anticipated. Bob
                    appointed Dr. Lawrence Roberts at MIT to build this network. At that time, he was trying to connect
                    large mainframe computers with each other, which was a problem due to the discrepancy in the
                    properties of the computer. Then came the idea to connect each of these large computers to
                    respective mini- computers to form a network; this way, one would have to deal with just the mini-
                    computer to connect. This also brought in a lot of support from other universities as by connecting
                    with the minicomputers, their private projects would not be disturbed on the main computer. Roberts
                    had the theory on paper, but the telephone companies did not believe in it, so someone else had to
                    build it. </p>

                <p>In 1968, Roberts finalized the engineers to bring his research into life by ARPAnet. It was going to
                    be
                    based upon <b>Interface message Processor</b> called the Imps and Packet switching. However, the giants of
                    communication and computers refused to fund the project by declaring it will not be successful. BBN
                    company was willing to try what ARPAnet has envisioned and won the contract headed by Frank Heart in
                    1969. UCLA and ARPAnet were working under a deadline to achieve this. Dr. Stephen Crocker, a
                    graduate
                    student, worked on the code to join the UCLA computers to the first IMP, which would become the
                    ARPAnet.
                    Since each computer was different, there had to be a common language that could speak to all. </p>

                <p>On Sep 1969, the first piece of hardware used to define this computer network arrived at UCLA. By the
                    end of the year, all four nodes were able to communicate. This success was a steppingstone for the
                    technology. Had this failed, the computer network theory could be abandoned by everyone. In 1971,
                    the ARPA net had 18 mainframe computers hooked into the network; Bob Metcalfe connected MIT
                    computers to this network and sent packets. </p>

                <p>The computer network connection created its first killer application, the <b>'Email</b>.' Raymond Tomlinson,
                    on a keystroke, gave the whole world the new icon for the information edge <b>'@</b>'
                    Email (Electronic mail) is a technique of exchanging messages between individuals using electronic
                    devices. Initially, the users could only send messages to users of the same computer. They needed
                    the author of the email and the recipient to be online simultaneously, which was similar to instant
                    messaging. Ray Tomlinson in 1971, developed the first system able to send email between users on
                    different hosts across the ARPANET. This idea took over the entire world. </p>

                <p>The brilliance of the Internet's design is that it is built with an open architecture. It laid a
                    foundation for many applications and possibilities. Anybody from a college student to a company
                    executive was allowed to code and give suggestions and share information. The rate of evolution on
                    Internet technology reached heights simply because so many could contribute to it. The first
                    international conference took place in 1972, where ARPAnet invited everybody who had an application
                    worth showcasing over the Internet, and what they found was 19 more new credible applications into
                    their application bucket of 25. However, during the demonstration, the IMP crashed, and the AT&T
                    executives were amused. Soon other networks were invented like LANs (Local area networks) and WANs
                    (Wide area networks). But each network was different in its design and hard to connect. In 1973, a
                    set of rules were invented called the <b>TCP/IP protocol (Gateway)</b>, which, if followed by each network,
                    could communicate across networks. </p>

                <p>Finally, in 1983, after ten years, PCP IP was marked down to be the common gateway for every network
                    on the Internet to connect to and convey information. Until now, the Internet was only open to the
                    government and its related associations, but that would change soon. This was a political decision
                    to be made which would bring the Internet into everyone's home and office. Along came a high rate of
                    inventions in the devices and hardware area that brought the mainframe computers to the size of a
                    desktop PC like the silicon chip, high-speed modem, and a mouse. </p>

                <p>In June 1992, Congress passed the bill to take the Internet from the exclusive hands of the
                    government and open it to the public. After this bill, so many new users with amazing ideas over the
                    Internet stimulated for commercial and personal usage; however, the major issue was to search for
                    this vast pool of information. The software was needed that could follow the threads of all this
                    knowledge across the world, find it, and convey it to the user. Tim Berners Lee from the CERN
                    research institute named this software as the World Wide Web. WWW gave the computer technology a
                    revolutionary wave beyond file transfers and emails. The World Wide Web was made more accessible by
                    another software called the <b>'Netscape' browser</b>, which enabled the internet web pages with more
                    functionalities like scroll bars, button clicks and made it more user friendly. Post this
                    breakthrough application 'Browser' by the end of 1993; the web grew by 341,000%. </p>

                <p> The group of netizens around the globe turned the Internet into a whole new world of possibilities
                    just by few clicks and keystrokes for business, games, dating, emails. By now, the www and @ were
                    the symbols of the information edge. The Internet was still under construction; the future would be
                    to bring in the voice and videos in communication. Researchers in the 21st century anticipated that
                    the internet revolution would continue to grow and bring communication across the world to another
                    level. </p>
