        <p>When Netscape and Microsoft fought the battle to be No.1</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div style="horiz-align:center;width: 100%;font-size: 20px">
                <p>During 1989, the Internet was being used only by computer nerds and researchers. A group of graduate
                    students from the University of Illinois decided to take the Internet to another level and make the
                    Internet accessible to the public. The thought awakened <b>Marc Andreessen</b> that if the public
                    gets
                    access to the Internet and can use it conveniently through the world wide web, then the
                    communications would become instantaneous and help grow the economy in an advanced manner globally.
                    They brought the concept of the browser to mass. The idea was to make browsers graphical and more
                    user-friendly for its regular users. Marc had worked on the first-ever browser, 'Mosaic' which came
                    to be known as the <b>'Netscape Navigator</b>.'
                    Netscape made their browsers available for public testing worldwide; they could catch errors and fix
                    them for a new browser release. </p>

                <p>Next, came the big question- who will fund it? <b>Jim Clark</b> forecasted the future and began to
                    push
                    Netscape to go public (IPO). He contacted Marc Andreessen and offered him a job in Silicon Valley
                    and set up a team of students to work on it. Jim's business venture worked well for Netscape's IPO
                    and exceeded all expectations. Clark alone made around $600 million in a day. Andreessen was a
                    well-known face by now and got immense popularity. 'Time' published Andreessen on the cover, giving
                    Netscape a brand identity that was soon to be challenged by it's biggest competitor and Tech giant
                    'Microsoft.'</p>

                <p><b>Microsoft</b> came into the fight of browsers to swallow Netscape and capture, dominate the
                    potential
                    market. It first offered to buy out Netscape and then threatened them to take over and demolish
                    Netscape. Microsoft had a significant advantage at that time concerning positioning it's a new
                    proposed browser (later to be known as Internet Explorer) since they had a monopoly in the operating
                    systems market. They knew they could compel the users to use Microsoft's browser other than
                    third-party browsers like Netscape. Netscape declined to bow down. Microsoft started building and
                    marketing its browser.</p>

                <p>Early 90's Microsoft started packaging the new browser (Internet Explorer) with it's Operating system
                    (Microsoft
                    Windows) to the users and had put in the clause in their T&C such that anyone using any browser
                    other than IE will lose their MS license. They tied up with major internet service providers to
                    promote and attract users towards <b>Internet Explorer</b>. On top of that, Microsoft offered this
                    browser for free with
                    it's OS. On the other side, Netscape's revenue model solely dependent on the pricing of Netscape.
                    Netscape started to feel the heat. Microsoft's strategy and aggressive marketing were gaining
                    momentum and thus taking the market share away from Netscape.</p>

                <p>The war between Netscape and Microsoft continued from here on, and both started making innovation and
                    updates. But it was getting too difficult for Netscape to keep up as they were losing revenue and
                    market share very rapidly. They open-sourced their browser to slow down the market share fall,
                    trading off with the revenue. That didn't work as well. By the late 90's Microsoft captured the
                    browser market by about 80%. Netscape was then sold to <b>AOL</b> for about $4.2 billion; thus, the
                    era of
                    browser war came to an end.</p>

                <p>In 2000, the presiding judge produced all the facts and pieces of evidence which proved that
                    Microsoft was abusing a monopoly position that was restricting the users from having a fair choice
                    in terms of browsers. This trial had a huge impact on <b>Bill Gates</b> personally and Microsoft for
                    years
                    to come. </p>

                <p>Though Microsoft won the browser war, for the time being; it was unaware that meanwhile, many other
                    open-source browsers were ready to launch themselves in the market and offer competitive services in
                    the early 2000s. </p>
